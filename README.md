# Gated-Accumulation
Repository for code from the paper "Gating an expectation of sensory timing balances anticipation with evidence accumulation". 

Scripts are separated into data analysis (behaviour.py) and model generation and fitting (gating.py)

Notebooks:

01_Behavioural_Data_Analysis.ipynb 
-Runs behavioural data analaysis on free choice saccade task and generates figures from the paper "                                "

02_Simulate_Gated_Accumulator.ipynb
-Visualizes simulations of gated accumulator model

03_Grouped_Model_Fitting.ipynb
-Fits models to group-average data and visualizes modell output

04_Individual_Model_Comparison.ipynb
-Fits gated and extended LATER model to individual participants, plots model errors
